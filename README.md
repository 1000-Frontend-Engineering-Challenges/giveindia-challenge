### Objective
A simple video player app where user can request videos to be played in a queue by adding YouTube links

Sample UI below. The app doesn't need to have fancy design. We are looking for functional implementation.

### Tasks
- The application must be a SPA.
- The application should allow user to add a youtube link to the playlist and start playing from the playlist first in first out.
- Once a video is finished, it should be removed from the playlist.
- The youtube link must be validated by the app for proper url format before adding to the queue.

### Bonus

- Allow the user to remove and reorder items in the playlist.
- Sync different versions of the application. If the application is open across two tabs, both must be in sync for all activities. For e.g adding/removing/forwarding a video on any one, should update both of them.
